# Rise Logger Web Component [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Rise-Vision/rise-logger/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Rise-Vision/rise-logger/tree/master)

## Introduction

The `rise-logger` Web Component uses Googleâ€™s [Big Query](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) to log usage data of a parent Rise Vision web component (eg. [rise-google-sheet](http://rise-vision.github.io/rise-google-sheet)). 

Rise Logger Web Component works in conjunction with [Rise Vision](http://www.risevision.com), the [digital signage management application](http://rva.risevision.com/) that runs on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com).

At this time Chrome is the only browser that this project and Rise Vision supports.

## Usage
To use the Rise Logger Web Component, you should first install it using Bower:
```
bower install https://github.com/Rise-Vision/rise-logger.git
```

Next, add an instance to your parent component in the dom-module. You should also include the source of  `rise-logger` before any code that executes in your parent component. For example:
```
<link rel="import" href="../rise-logger/rise-logger.html">

<dom-module id="my-component">
  <template>
    <rise-logger id="logger"></rise-logger>
    <content></content>
  </template>
</dom-module>

<script>
  (function() {
    "use strict";

    Polymer({
      is: "my-component",

      properties: {},
      
      /**
       * Polymer has finished its initialization. This is the entry point.
       */
      ready: function() {
        // log usage
        this.$.logger.log("my-component-table", {
          "event": "ready"
        });
      }
      
    })();
</script>
```

## Development

### Dependencies
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) - Git is a free and open source distributed version control system that is used to manage our source code on Github.
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) & [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - npm is the default package manager for Node.js. npm runs through the command line and manages dependencies for an application. These dependencies are listed in the _package.json_ file.
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) - Bower is a package manager for Javascript libraries and frameworks. All third-party Javascript dependencies are listed in the _bower.json_ file.
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - Gulp is a Javascript task runner. It lints, runs unit and E2E (end-to-end) tests, minimizes files, etc. Gulp tasks are defined in _gulpfile.js_.
* [Polyserve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polyserve) - A simple web server for using bower components locally.

### Local Development Environment Setup and Installation
To make changes to the web component, you'll first need to install the dependencies:

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node.js and npm](http://blog.nodeknockout.com/post/65463770933/how-to-install-node-js-and-npm)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/#install-bower) - To install Bower, run the following command in Terminal: `npm install -g bower`. Should you encounter any errors, try running the following command instead: `sudo npm install -g bower`.
- [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) - To install Gulp, run the following command in Terminal: `npm install -g gulp`. Should you encounter any errors, try running the following command instead: `sudo npm install -g gulp`.

The web components can now be installed by executing the following commands in Terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Rise-Vision/rise-logger.git
cd rise-logger
npm install
bower install
```

### Testing
You can run the suite of tests either by command terminal or via a local web server using Polyserve. 

#### Command Terminal
Execute the following command in Terminal to run tests:

```
gulp test
```

#### Local Server
Run the following command in Terminal: `polyserve`.

Now in your browser, navigate to: 

```
localhost:8080/components/rise-logger/test/index.html
```

### Deployment
Once you are satisifed with your changes, deploy the contents of the `bower_components` folder to a folder on your server and also create a `rise-logger` folder within your folder and upload `rise-logger.html` to it. You can then use the web component by following the *Usage* instructions.
